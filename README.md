 # What is this?

A necessarily simple adventure game program created for the [Adafruit PyBadge computer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200).  A playable version can be found at [https://bazbt3.github.io/pybadge-adventure/](https://bazbt3.github.io/pybadge-adventure/)

## Controls at the start of the project

* Advancing between moves: button A.
* Movement: N = up button, E = left, S = down, W = right.

## Enhancements intended

* Basic combat, potentially using a combination of the Select and Start buttons.

## What is an Adafruit PyBadge?

An [embedded system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system) computer the size of a credit card.  It has a 1.8" colour display, 5 bright 'NeoPixel' LEDs, 8 'game' buttons, an accelerometer and buzzer built-in, and a comprehensive set of interface options for external sensors and controllers.  It can run CircuitPython, MakeCode Arcade or Arduino code, which must be written on a computer or a portable device before 'flashing' the program to the PyBadge via a USB cable.

## How was the program created?

It uses the Microsoft MakeCode IDE (blocks of code similar to Scratch.)  In this case all the coding has used [the arcade.makecode.com web application](https://arcade.makecode.com) with some ancillary files (e.g. this one) edited in the Microsoft VS Code code editor.

Note: I have used only the block editor for code creation so be aware that the underlying 'written' code may not be ordered 'neatly'.
